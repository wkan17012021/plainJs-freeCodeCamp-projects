# JavaScript Mini-Project Practice

## A repo of small projects for improving plain JS skills

Based on John Smilga's repo for source code in conjunction with FreeCodeCamp's video tutorials found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=467s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

## Projects

- **Color Flipper 🌈** : randomly generates a background colour either from a predefined list or randomly generates on the fly a hex code combination. Learn about DOM manipulation.
- **Counter App 🧮**: increase, decrease, reset features. Learn about state management.
- **Reviews Dialog Slider 🌠**: slider buttons to move the dialog forward and reverse. Randomiser button. State management.
- **Responsive Navbar🧭**: most of this is css controlled responsive design. It contains a hamburger icon on mobile which toggles the mobile menu.
- **Sidebar toggle 📤 📥**: similar to before, toggling some markup on and off canvas by switching a classname on and off.
- **Basic Modal 💬**: similar to before, toggling some styles in a classname on and off using button event listeners. Added bg-image switch.
- **Basic Accordion 🪗**: learned to use some event properties I hadn't used before in order to traverse the DOM and trigger the accordion open section when the + icon is clicked.
- **Menu **: Couldn't complete this one in the first attempt and wasn't sure whether using innerHTML is a valid solution to inject a load of content to filter options. Will revisit this to see if there is a more manageable/maintainable solution in the future.
- **Video Custom Player 🎥**: This was good practice with the video web api. I learned that you can create your own video controls to manipulate the existing HTML5 default controls (give it more functionality). The app also shows a basic implementation of a loader screen which shows before the whole content is loaded. Useful if the page contains heavy processing such as a video.
