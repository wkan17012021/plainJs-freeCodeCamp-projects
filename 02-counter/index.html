        John's solution was more succinct. I added individual functions and
        event listeners to assign the button features.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would have been more concise (D-R-Y) to use querSelectorAll for all
        buttons using a shared class, loop over them to identify which button
        was clicked and apply the appropriate functionality.
      </p>
      <p>Check out his source code for how he solved this issue:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Using querySelectorAll to grab all elements with btn classname. Note
          that a nodelist is returned which is array-like, and affords limited
          manipulation methods like forEach() which he uses to iterate over.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now we can pass in to the call back function, on each button, attach
          an event listener of type 'click'.
        </li>
        <li>
          He then identifies which button was clicked but interrogating the
          event object by logging e.currentTarget.
        </li>
        <li>
          With currentTarget, you then have access to the classlist via
          e.currentTarget.classList
        </li>
        <li>Use an if/else statement to check if the variable saved to e.currentTarget.classList contains a 'decrease', 'reset', 'increase' class, then apply the appropriate functionality </li>
      </ol>
